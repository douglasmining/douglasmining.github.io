        <p class="paragraph-4">9. Investors Should Not Rely on Forward-Looking Information</p>
        <p class="paragraph-4">Some of the statements on our Web Site, including those relating to projected future financial performance or events, are considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, specifically the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give our expectations or forecasts of future events. Sometimes these statements will use words such as &quot;anticipate,&quot; &quot;estimate,&quot; &quot;expect,&quot; &quot;project,&quot; &quot;intend,&quot; &quot;plan,&quot; &quot;believe,&quot; &quot;outlook,&quot; &quot;forecast,&quot; and other similar words. These statements are not guarantees of our future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual performance to be materially different from those we project.<br><br>Our actual results will be different due to the inherent nature of projections and may be better or worse than projected. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements also represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they initially were made. We expressly disclaim a duty to provide updates to any forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, to reflect events or circumstances or changes in expectations or the occurrence of anticipated events after the date they initially were made. <br><br>The following factors could affect the forward- looking statements: the ability to achieve or quantify savings for our customers or ourselves through our global cost-cutting program and other financial management programs; the ability to obtain, or the timing of obtaining, future government awards and contracts; the availability of government funding and customer requirements; changes in government priorities due to program reviews or revisions to strategic objectives; difficulties in developing and producing operationally advanced technology systems; the competitive environment; economic, business and political conditions domestically and internationally; the timing and customer acceptance of product deliveries and launches; the outcome of contingencies, including litigation, environmental remediation, program performance, and completion of any acquisitions and divestitures. These are only some of the numerous factors which may affect the forward-looking statements contained on our Web Site.</p>
